Need a web design and logo for a new debate website.  The site is not intended to be tailored to rigid professionals and politicians.  The aim is to be a fun way for anyone and everyone to engage in serious or light hearted or comical debate, including sports fans, movie buffs, activists, politicians, scientists and my grandmother if she feels like debating about apple pie.

The site will focus on having custom structured sides (or viewpoints) to every debate which will allow for potentially very useful statistical information.  You will see this concept in the provided mocks.

Candidates must have skill with font and text design as well as graphic design as they will both be key elements of the site.

The design must not feel corporate, political, like a news dashboard, or otherwise "boring".  Think more along the lines of twitter, fresh, clean and fun.

I envision a logo that feels almost "sketched".  Something that will take the edge of the concept of debating and make it feel a little more fun
